# Stacklands CompactStorage Mod

Store cards more compactly to reduce clutter and lag.

This adds three new cards:

- Food Warehouse: Stores 100 food points worth of food and food inside won't spoil.
- Magic Pouch: Stores any 30 cards
- Stacked Warehouses: Combines all sheds and warehouses into one (any warehouse or shed put on top gets absorbed)

The ideas for the cards can be found in the advanced ideas booster pack on the Mainland (Stacked Warehouses) and Island (Food Warehouse and Magic Pouch).

## Development

- Build using `dotnet build`
- For release builds, add `-c Release`
- If you're using VSCode, the `.vscode/tasks.json` file allows building via `Run Build`/`Ctrl+Shift+B`
